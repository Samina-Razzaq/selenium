it is approx a 40 alphanumeric character ID

Thread.sleep() static wait/unconditional wait
Types of selenium waits:
Implicit wait
Explicit wait
Fluent wait
Implicit wait:
it tells the web driver to wait for certain amount of time before throwing exception and it will only be written once and will be a
applied to the whole session of the execution .We can say that implicit wait is a global wait
implicit wait works with findElement()
waits for elements to get located on page and ignore the rest time
implicit wait is usually set to 20 sec if your element is found in given time remaining time will be ignored
and script will move on to perform next line action
if the element is not found in given time only then you will get an exception
