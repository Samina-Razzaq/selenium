Alerts:

Alert is a pop up message. Alert takes a complete focus of our main page that we are working on
we cannot proceed until it is handled.

3 types of Alerts:
1- web based alerts/html alerts- the alerts which we can  inspect and perform need actions.
2- javascript alerts/ browser alerts-- the alerts which we can not inspect we can handle these alerts by using switch to method.

 3- Widows based alerts-- we cannot handle with Selenium

 Types of JS alerts.
 1- Simple alert-- click ok
 2- confirmation alert. --enter cancel or chick ok
 3-Prompt alert. ---enter the text and click ok or cancel.
 4-
 To handle Js alerts we only have 4 methods:
 1- accept(); -- click ok.
 2- dismiss();-- click cancel
 3- getText()--
 4-- sendKeys.

 To handle authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in the URL
"https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth";
                                //username:password@

Frames:

Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage.
Frame allow devs to represent multiple views on one page.
3 ways to interact with Frames:
1. by index
2. by name or Id
3.by webElement

in alert- switch to alert and switch automatically back.
but in frames -- switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page.

How to do you handle Alerts in selenium?
We handle Alerts by using Alert interface.
